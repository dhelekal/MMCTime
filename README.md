# MMCTime

MMCTime is a package for timing (dating) mutation scaled pathogen phylogenies under Lambda coalescents.
Lambda coalescents, also known as Multiple Merger Coalescents are genealogic models that admit multiple mergers. This enables timing of phylogenies which may contain true polytomies. Polytomies in pathogen genealogies can be related to various phenomena of interest, such as superspreading, selective sweeps, or rapid adaptation.
The implementation framework is similar to `LSD`, `BactDating`, and `treedater`.

For usage see vignette.
